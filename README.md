Due to the busy world around us, we sometimes fail to check or get instat update of our near and dear ones. So we have created this project which helps in monitoring health of Patients to their best using technology and sensors.It also helps in tracking one's health with the help of 3 sensors.Our project consist of several elements of Hardware and 3 Sensors as well.
Working of our Project:
The Arduino Uno will Read data from pulse Rate sensor ,Temperature Sensor and Humidity Sensor and send it to the smart healthcare portal where real time data will be displayed in Graphical Representation.
Historical Data is also stored and can be accessed using History page . The data sent from Arduino will be Checked against optimal body parameters.
Whenever the pulse rate  or body Temperature or Humidity rises above or falls below the optimal parameter ,the Smart Health care Portal will Notify the user of the patientâ€™s condition via . push notification. We were under the guidance of Prof. Poonam B. Lad and took steps accordingly.
